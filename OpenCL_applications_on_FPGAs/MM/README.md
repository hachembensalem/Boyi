## MM

This application provides a kernel that implements the standard <b>matrix multiplication</b> operation <i>C</i>= <i>A</i> * <i>B</i>, where 
- <i>A</i> is a 2048 * 1024 matrix, and
- <i>B</i> is a 1024 * 1024 matrix, and
- <i>C</i> is a 2048 * 1024 matrix.

This application is a demo provide by Intel FPGA. Please see [Intel FPGA OpenCL Design Examples page](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/programmable/products/design-software/embedded-software-developers/opencl/support.html "Title") for more details.
