The <b>Mandelbrot set</b> is the set of complex numbers <i>c</i> for which the function $f_c(z)=z^2+c$ does not diverge when iterated from $z=0$, i.e., for which $f_c(f_c(0))$, etc., remains bounded in absolute value. Mandelbrot set images may be created by sampling the complex numbers and testing.

The default value of width and height of the window are 800 and  400 respectively, and they can be changed.
