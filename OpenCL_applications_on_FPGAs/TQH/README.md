## TQH

This is a <b>histogram application</b> that is built on top of a <b>task queue system</b>, where the CPU reads and enqueues frames of a video sequence and the FPGA calculates a histogram of pixel brightness in each frame.

This application is from Chai benchmarks. Please see [the original repo](https://github.com/chai-benchmarks/chai "Title") for more details.
