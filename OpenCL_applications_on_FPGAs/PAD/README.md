## PAD

<b>Padding</b> is a data manipulation primitive that inserts space between elements of an array. It is commonly used for memory alignment adjustment and matrix transposition. We use in-place stream compaction which unidirectionally shifts data in memory to expand an array.

This application is from Chai benchmarks. Please see [the original repo](https://github.com/chai-benchmarks/chai "Title") for more details.
